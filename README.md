I'm Samet from Austria, and I do content on Design and Development. In addition to software development, I have a keen interest in game development. In my free time, I develop my own 2D and 3D games using the Godot engine and have experience with Unity and Unreal Engine.

Skills: C# / JS / HTML / CSS
